# Bank Customer Churn Analysis with Power BI

## Overview

This project utilizes Power BI for analyzing and visualizing customer churn data from a bank. Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. By analyzing various factors that contribute to churn, the bank can develop strategies to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about bank customers, including demographics, account details, transaction history, and churn status. Before loading the dataset into Power BI, ensure that it is clean and properly formatted for analysis.

## Project Components

### Data Collection

- Collect the dataset containing customer churn data from a reliable source.
- Load the dataset into Power BI for further analysis.

### Data Preparation

- Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies.
- Format and reshape the data as needed for analysis.
- Ensure data quality and integrity for accurate insights.

### Data Modeling

- Create queries to model the data for analysis.
- Establish relationships between different tables in the dataset.
- Utilize Power BI's data modeling capabilities to structure the data for efficient analysis.

### Data Analysis

- Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create measures and calculated columns for deriving meaningful insights.
- Analyze various factors contributing to customer churn, such as demographics, account types, transaction behavior, etc.
- Identify patterns and trends in the data to understand the drivers of churn.

### Data Visualization

- Develop interactive dashboards and reports to visualize the analyzed data.
- Utilize Power BI's rich visualization options to present insights effectively.
- Create interactive filters and slicers for exploring different aspects of customer churn.
- Design intuitive and user-friendly dashboards for easy interpretation of data.
